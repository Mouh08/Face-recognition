# Face-recognition

The potential of facial and facial expression recognitions has gained increased interest in social interactions and biometric
identification. Earlier facial identification methods suffer from drawbacks due to the lower identification accuracy under
difficult lighting conditions. This code presents two novel new descriptors called Histogram of Directional Gradient (HDG)
and Histogram of Directional Gradient Generalized (HDGG) to extracting discriminant facial expression features for better
classification accuracy with good efficiency than existing classifiers. The proposed descriptors are based on the directional
local gradients combined with SVM (Support Vector Machine) linear classification. To build an efficient face and facial
expression recognition, features with reduced dimension are used to boost the performance of the classification. Experiments
are conducted on two public-domain datasets: JAFFE for facial expression recognition and YALE for face recognition. The
experiment results show the best overall accuracy of 92.12% compared to other existing works. It demonstrates a fast execution
time for face recognition ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 s in all evaluated databases.
